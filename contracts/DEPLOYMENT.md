# SubTrackr Contract Deployment Guide

This guide describes how to deploy SubTrackr smart contracts to various Stellar networks using the provided automation scripts.

## Contract Architecture (Upgradeable)

SubTrackr is deployed as three Soroban contracts:

- **Proxy** (`subtrackr-proxy` / `UpgradeableProxy`): Stable contract ID used by the app. Manages upgrades (timelock, history, rollback scheduling) and forwards calls to the current implementation.
- **Storage** (`subtrackr-storage` / `SubTrackrStorage`): Holds all subscription state (plans, subscriptions, indexes). Only the currently-authorized implementation can write to it.
- **Implementation** (`subtrackr-subscription` / `SubTrackrSubscription`): Business logic. Can be upgraded by deploying a new implementation contract and updating the proxy.

The **proxy contract ID never changes** during upgrades, so subscribers and integrators don’t need to update addresses.

## Prerequisites

- [Soroban CLI](https://developers.stellar.org/docs/smart-contracts/getting-started/setup#install-the-soroban-cli) installed.
- [Rust](https://rustup.rs/) and `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target installed.
- A Stellar account with enough XLM for the target network.

## Deployment Scripts

All scripts are located in the `scripts/` directory at the project root.

### 1. Local Deployment

For development and testing on a local Soroban network.

```bash
./scripts/deploy-local.sh
```

**Note**: Assumes a local network is running and an identity `alice` exists.

### 2. Testnet Deployment

For deploying to the Stellar Testnet.

```bash
export SOROBAN_ACCOUNT="your-testnet-account-name"
export ADMIN_ADDRESS="GB..."
./scripts/deploy-testnet.sh
```

### 3. Mainnet Deployment

For deploying to the Stellar Public network (Mainnet).

```bash
export SOROBAN_ACCOUNT="your-mainnet-account-name"
export ADMIN_ADDRESS="GD..."
./scripts/deploy-mainnet.sh
```

**⚠️ WARNING**: Mainnet deployment costs real XLM. Ensure you have sufficient funds and have reviewed the contract code.

## Environment Variables

| Variable          | Description                                                                        | Required For     |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- |
| `SOROBAN_ACCOUNT` | The identity name (configured in Soroban CLI) or secret key to use for deployment. | Testnet, Mainnet |
| `ADMIN_ADDRESS`   | The Stellar address that will be set as the contract admin during initialization.  | Testnet, Mainnet |
| `UPGRADE_DELAY_SECS` | Minimum delay (seconds) between scheduling and executing an upgrade.           | Testnet, Mainnet |
| `ROLLBACK_DELAY_SECS` | Delay (seconds) used when scheduling a rollback via `rollback()`.            | Testnet, Mainnet |

## Verification

After deployment, you can verify that the contract is active by running:

```bash
./scripts/verify.sh <PROXY_ID> <NETWORK> [SOURCE]
```

Replace `<PROXY_ID>` with the proxy contract ID returned by the deployment script and `<NETWORK>` with `local`, `testnet`, or `public`.

### Explorer Source Verification

Some explorers (e.g., Stellar Expert / Soroban explorers) support attaching source bundles for transparency.

1) Build the WASM (optional, for checksum reference):

```bash
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown --manifest-path contracts/Cargo.toml
```

2) Package the contract source:

```bash
./scripts/package-source.sh
```

This generates a tar.gz in `dist/` containing:
- `contracts/Cargo.toml`
- `contracts/proxy/**`
- `contracts/storage/**`
- `contracts/subscription/**`
- `contracts/types/**`
- `WASM_SHA256.txt` (if a compiled WASM was found)

3) Upload the tar.gz bundle to your chosen explorer’s contract page (or submit via their form/API), referencing your deployed `PROXY_ID` (and optionally the storage/implementation IDs).

Notes:
- Ensure the license header is present in your sources if required by the explorer.
- Keep optimizer/toolchain settings consistent across builds for reproducibility.

## Upgrade Procedure

### 1) Deploy a new implementation

Build and deploy the updated `subtrackr-subscription` contract.

You can use the helper script (deploy + schedule):

```bash
export SOROBAN_ACCOUNT="your-network-identity"
export ADMIN_ADDRESS="G..."
./scripts/upgrade-deploy-and-schedule.sh <PROXY_ID> <NETWORK>
```

This deploys a new implementation and schedules the upgrade via `authorize_upgrade`.

### 2) Wait for the timelock

Upgrades are timelocked. The proxy enforces:
- `execute_after >= now + upgrade_delay_secs`

### 3) Execute the upgrade

```bash
./scripts/upgrade-execute.sh <PROXY_ID> <IMPLEMENTATION_ID> <NETWORK>
```

Execution calls `upgrade_to(implementation)` which:
- Updates the storage contract to authorize writes from the new implementation
- Runs `validate_upgrade(...)` and `migrate(...)` when needed
- Updates `get_version()` (storage schema version)
- Appends to upgrade history

### Storage Migrations & Versions

`get_version()` on the proxy represents the **storage schema version**.

When changing storage layout between versions:
- Bump the implementation’s `STORAGE_VERSION`
- Implement `migrate(proxy, storage, from_version)`
- Keep migrations **forward-only** and deterministic

## Rollback Procedure (Timelocked)

If the latest implementation is faulty, the proxy can schedule a rollback to the immediately-previous implementation:

1) Schedule rollback:

```bash
./scripts/rollback-schedule.sh <PROXY_ID> <NETWORK>
```

2) After the rollback delay elapses, execute the scheduled rollback with `upgrade_to(...)`.

Notes:
- Rollback changes the **implementation**, not the already-applied storage schema.
- Keep older implementations forward-compatible when possible (e.g., additive storage changes).
