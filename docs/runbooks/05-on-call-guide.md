# Runbook: On-Call Guide

Reference for engineers on the SubTrackr on-call rotation.

---

## Responsibilities

- Acknowledge PagerDuty alerts within SLA (P1: 15 min, P2: 1 hour)
- Triage and classify incidents using [02-incident-response.md](./02-incident-response.md)
- Escalate when resolution is not achievable within the SLA window
- Complete shift handoff notes before rotating off

---

## Tools & Access

| Tool | Purpose | Access |
| ---- | ------- | ------ |
| PagerDuty | Alert routing and escalation | On-call rotation |
| Soroban CLI | Contract inspection and invocation | `soroban` binary + account identity |
| Stellar Expert | Contract event explorer | https://stellar.expert |
| Stellar Status | Network health | https://status.stellar.org |
| Monitoring dashboard | `monitoringService.getDashboard()` | App backend |
| Audit log | `auditService.query(...)` | App backend |

---

## Start of Shift

1. Review open incidents and alerts from the outgoing engineer
2. Check monitoring dashboard for any active alerts:
   ```ts
   monitoringService.getActiveAlerts();
   ```
3. Verify contract is reachable:
   ```bash
   soroban contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ID --network $NETWORK -- get_subscription_count
   ```
4. Confirm DR drill is green (run if last drill was >24 hours ago):
   ```bash
   npm run dr:drill
   ```
5. Review recent audit log for anomalies:
   ```ts
   auditService.query({ from: Date.now() - 86_400_000 }); // last 24h
   ```

## Alert Response Quick Reference

| Alert | Runbook | First Action |
| ----- | ------- | ------------ |
| `high-failure-rate` | [02-incident-response.md](./02-incident-response.md#scenario-a--high-transaction-failure-rate) | Check `dashboard.recentMetrics` |
| `gas-spike` | [02-incident-response.md](./02-incident-response.md) | Check for runaway charge loops |
| Contract unreachable | [02-incident-response.md](./02-incident-response.md#scenario-b--contract-unreachable) | Check https://status.stellar.org |
| Notification outage | [02-incident-response.md](./02-incident-response.md#scenario-d--notification-delivery-failure) | Check Expo push service |
| Backup checksum failure | [04-troubleshooting.md](./04-troubleshooting.md#backup-checksum-failure) | List and verify all backups |
| Audit chain break | [04-troubleshooting.md](./04-troubleshooting.md#audit-chain-verification-fails) | Treat as P1 security incident |

---

## Escalation Matrix

| Condition | Escalate To | How |
| --------- | ----------- | --- |
| P1 incident unresolved after 15 min | Engineering lead | PagerDuty escalation policy |
| Contract redeployment required | Contract admin key holder | Direct contact |
| Security breach suspected | Security team | security@subtrackr.example.com |
| Stellar network outage | No internal escalation | Monitor https://status.stellar.org |

---

## Common Commands

```bash
# Check contract health
soroban contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ID --network $NETWORK -- get_subscription_count
soroban contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ID --network $NETWORK -- get_plan_count

# Inspect a subscription
soroban contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ID --network $NETWORK \
  -- get_subscription --subscription_id <ID>

# Deactivate a plan (containment)
soroban contract invoke --id $CONTRACT_ID --network $NETWORK \
  -- deactivate_plan --merchant $MERCHANT --plan_id <ID>

# Run DR drill
npm run dr:drill

# Run integration tests
npx jest --testPathPattern="integration" --no-coverage
```

---

## End of Shift Handoff

Complete the following before rotating off:

- [ ] All P1/P2 incidents resolved or handed off with context
- [ ] Open alerts documented with current status
- [ ] Any contract state changes (deactivations, refunds) logged
- [ ] Handoff notes written and shared with incoming engineer
- [ ] DR drill run if not done in the last 24 hours
